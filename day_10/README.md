# Day 10

Today's solution is in [ALGOL 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68). Honestly, I
like the language, but editor/IDE support is practically non-existent and documentation
is a pain to look up - I ended up referring to [these](https://github.com/addrummond/aoc_2021_algol68) Advent of Code 2021 solutions as a base for my solution.

## Usage

Install `algol68g`, the ALGOL 68 compiler.

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```

Omitting the file path will just assume that you meant to run it with `input.txt`:

```bash
./run.sh
```
