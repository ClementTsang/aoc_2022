# Day 7

Today's language of choice is Jakt.

I kinda cheated a bit today, and did a first run in Python. I was originally going to do PureScript, but it was proving
to be really annoying to do for this sort of problem. Jakt was fun though, it's a pretty easy language to work with,
though IMO the documentation is a bit lacking at the moment (or I just couldn't find it) - not surprising with how new
it is though.

## Usage

Install [Jakt](https://github.com/SerenityOS/jakt) and Clang. Run the build script:

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```

As usual, omitting the file path will instead assume you want to run it against some file named `input.txt`:

```bash
./run.sh
```
