# Day 1

Got lazy today since I forgot AoC started, and didn't want to learn something too hard at 4AM. Decided to go with Crystal
since it was the first language that popped into my head and it was similar enough to Ruby, a language I've had more
than enough experience in with during my time at Shopify. The problem itself was pretty straightforward though, so I
didn't really have to test out much of the language to get my solutions.

As for my solution itself, I just went with a super lazy 3-element array representing the top three elements. I could
have gone fancy with some other data structure but this works so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
