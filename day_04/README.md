# Day 4

For the fourth day of Advent of Code, so how could I not use... Forth!

...but it if wasn't for the joke, honestly, I wouldn't have bothered. As always,
I'm sure it's my fault because I'm basically speed-running learning new languages,
but this was... kinda painful.

Part of it is just that it's a very different language style from what I'm used to,
so while the problem itself was very simple, and thinking this way was actually
really fun, it did take quite a bit longer than normal to write it in a way Forth
wanted (especially when trying to do it without variables, which I discovered a
bit later than I probably should have).

The other is that... well, part of it is because I'm trying to work quickly and read
fast, but I didn't have a fun time with the Forth documentation. I had to refer to
some past Advent of Code Forth solutions to figure out stuff like how they managed
to read from a file.

## Usage

Install the gforth compiler, then run:

```bash
./run.sh
```
