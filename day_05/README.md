# Day 5

Today's solution is in Haxe. This wasn't that hard of a problem, mostly just string input parsing. Not much to say
either regarding the choice of language. Haxe feels very similar to Java in terms of feel so it was pretty
straightforward to write and figure out how to get the language to do what I wanted.

## Usage

Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/). To run, do:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This assumes that a file named `input.txt` is in the same directory.

You can pass in a specific text file like so:

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```
