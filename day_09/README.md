# Day 9

Today's language of choice is Elixir. I was originally considering either Vale or Carbon, but getting both of them up
and running was proving to be tricky so I switched.

This was pretty fun, Elixir is this nice mixture of functional language and not being too restrictive such that
it's very easy to put out a solution. Setting it up was also easy, as well as the tooling and documentation. All in all,
I really enjoyed working with Elixir.

## Usage

Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Run:

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```

As usual, omitting the file path will just assume you mean to run it with `input.txt`:

```bash
./run.sh
```
