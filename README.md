Another Advent of Code, [another](https://github.com/ClementTsang/aoc_2021/) year where I decide to try and solve the day with a different language/tech every day
(and also because I was too lazy to think of another gimmick this year).

As another (optional) challenge, I'm going to try and select things that I've never used before as well. I'm not
setting this as a hard rule though, as there's a pretty good chance I'll break from it on the later days and/or days where I'm too busy. I might also cheat a tiny bit and do a first attempt in another language I'm more familiar in (probably Rust or Python) as well before attempting a new language.
