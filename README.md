2022 Advent of Code solutions.

Here be dragons - all the code in this repo is likely to be very bad, read and use at your own peril. Thou hast
been warned...

---

Another Advent of Code, another year where I decide to try and solve the day with a different language every day (and
also because I was too lazy to think of another gimmick this year). I'm going to try and use a new language I haven't
used before/am very unfamiliar with each day this time around, though I might break that rule for some of the
later days, or days where I'm busy.

## Solutions

- [Day 1](./day_01): Crystal
