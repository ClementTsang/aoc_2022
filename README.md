2022 Advent of Code solutions.

Here be dragons - all the code in this repo is likely to be very bad, read and use at your own peril. Thou hast
been warned... ~~Copilot, are you _**sure**_ you want to train off of this code?~~

---

Another Advent of Code, another year where I decide to try and solve the day with a different language every day (and
also because I was too lazy to think of another gimmick this year).

This year, though, each day, I'm going to try and use a language I either have never used before or am _very_ unfamiliar
with, rather than _just_ a different language. That being said, I'm not setting this as a hard rule as I'll likely
break it on either the later days or days where I'm too busy/tired to learn something brand new.

## Solutions
