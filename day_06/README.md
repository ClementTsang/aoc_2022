# Day 6

Today's language of choice is [Ada](https://www.adaic.org) . The problem wasn't too hard (just use a set), and the language itself was pretty
easy to work with. The thing that took the longest time was installing the formatting tool from AUR...

## Usage

Install `gcc-ada`, then run `./run.sh`. As always, you can pass in the file path like `./run.sh example.txt`, or
omit it and let it assume you're working with `input.txt`.
