# Day 6

Today's language of choice is [Ada](https://www.adaic.org) . The problem wasn't too hard (just use a set), and the language itself was pretty
easy to work with. The thing that took the longest time was installing the formatting tool from AUR...

## Usage

Install `gcc-ada`, then run:

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```

You can omit the file argument to default to `input.txt`.
