# Day 13

Today's language of choice is... Python. Yeah, I'm going to use my "Python as my daily solution" card here today. I don't have much time today, and I really don't want to use another language (maybe Rust or something would still be okay) to parse this right now.

## Usage

Install Python. Run:

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```

Omitting the file path will just assume that you meant to run it with `input.txt`:

```bash
./run.sh
```
