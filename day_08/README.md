# Day 8

Today's main solution is in PureScript. I was going to do this yesterday but it wasn't really a great fit for that problem, so now I'm doing it today.

As for working the language itself... it's alright, I guess. I've used Haskell before for school and the previous Advent of Code, as well as functional languages in general, so it wasn't too much of a jump. That said, it was a bit tricky figuring out the ecosystem and some of the syntax. The tooling in VS Code was a also bit spotty and kept crashing, which is a bit problematic for me since I often lean a bit on some compiler/editor hints when new. Otherwise, not too bad, and an interesting functional option when in the JS ecosystem.

Cheated a bit today as well and did my initial solution in Python. Wasn't too
familiar with PureScript so this helped me sketch out the solution first before
diving into the language.

## Usage

To run, install [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/), then run the `./run.sh` script with the path to your input:

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```

As usual, omitting the file path will just assume you mean to run it with `input.txt`.
