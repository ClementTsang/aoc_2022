# Day 11

Today's language of choice is Pascal. Not that hard of a problem today, though writing the parsing code was a bit
annoying. Funny how this is the second day in a row where I've had to write an integer-parsing function.

## Usage

Install [`fpc`](https://www.freepascal.org/), the Free Pascal compiler. Then run:

```bash
./run.sh example.txt
```

Omitting the file path will just assume that you meant to run it with `input.txt`:

```bash
./run.sh
```
